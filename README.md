# deploy-recipe-please

## Full stack applications that allows to add, edit, view different recipes that are stored within my database.

### This project was created as I wanted a convenient location to view the various recipes that I find throughout social medias.
### I enjoy updating them and experimenting with the ingredients, editing allows for my customization and continued changes.
### I also enjoy learning to cook, from sous vide, to using a smoker, growing my own veggies and more. 
### This one just might become a MERN Application and be a mix for gardening seed organizations and tracking, along with using possible ingredients for recipes.
